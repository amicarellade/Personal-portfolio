## Notice

I have tried making this website as adaptable and flexible for all user monitors, however, I am not perfect and am sure there will be some mistakes along the way. Feel free to email me with recommendations or bugs you have found along the way. Additionally, I have included a screenshot of what the website landing page ~should~ look like.
